- 👋 Hi, I’m Boseong Kim, Korea Technical Enablement Lead @ IBM Quantum
- 👀 I’m interested in Hamiltonians in different systems and how each translates to the quantum circuit, i.e., quantum simulation and its complexity
- 🌱 I’m currently studying quantum contextuality and its application to quantum advantage
- 💞️ I’m looking for whom can interact with me about basic lattice field theory and its simulation
- 📫 Please contact me at boseong14@gmail.com or boseong.kim@ibm.com
