- 👋 Hi, I’m Boseong Kim, MSc student in Quantum Technologies @ UCL
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum information theory on quantum advantage and quantum computation for many-body physics
- 🌱 I’m currently studying quantum contextuality and its application to quantum advantage
- 💞️ I’m looking for whom can interact with me about quantum computation for physical/mathematical problems
- 📫 Please contact me at boseong.kim.22@ucl.ac.uk or boseong14@gmail.com
