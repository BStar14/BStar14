- 👋 Hi, I’m Boseong Kim @ UCL
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum information theory on quantum advantage and quantum simulation of physical systems
- 🌱 I’m currently studying about quantum contextuality, quantum walks on quantum computers, and pulse control of quantum gates
- 💞️ I’m looking for whom can interact with me about quantum advantage in mathematical or physical problems
- 📫 Please contact me at boseong14@gmail.com
